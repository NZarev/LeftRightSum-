1.Initialize Program and Scanner:
  Import the Scanner class to take input from the user.
  Create a Scanner object to read inputs from the console.
2.Input the Number of Elements (n):
  Prompt the user to enter an integer, n, representing the number of elements in each group (left and right).
  Read the integer value for n and store it.
3.Initialize Variables for Sums:
  Create two integer variables, leftSum and rightSum, and initialize them to 0.
  These variables will store the sum of the first and second groups of n integers, respectively.
4.Calculate leftSum for the First n Elements:
  Create a for loop that iterates n times to read the first group of n integers.
  In each iteration, read an integer from the input and add it to leftSum.
5.Calculate rightSum for the Next n Elements:
  Create another for loop that iterates n times to read the second group of n integers.
  In each iteration, read an integer from the input and add it to rightSum.
6.Compare leftSum and rightSum:
  Use an if-else statement to check if leftSum is equal to rightSum.
    If Equal: Print Yes, sum = followed by the value of leftSum, indicating both groups have equal sums.
    If Not Equal: Calculate the absolute difference between leftSum and rightSum (using Math.abs(leftSum - rightSum)), then print No, diff = followed by the calculated difference.
7.End the Program:
  The program terminates after displaying whether the sums are equal or the difference if they are not.
